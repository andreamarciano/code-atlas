# Code Atlas - Fullstack Project with React, Node.js, Prisma & PostgreSQL

This is a fullstack project showcasing a modern web app stack, built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **ORM:** Prisma  
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

---

## Project Overview

**Code Atlas** is a personal technical documentation platform inspired by sites like `W3Schools` and `TutorialRepublic`.  
It provides a scalable, type-safe architecture to create, manage, and serve tutorial content on programming languages and technologies.

### Core Features

- A **dynamic content management system** for tutorials, where content (sections, topics, code snippets) is stored in PostgreSQL and managed via Prisma.  
- Backend API exposing content via REST endpoints built with Express and Prisma.  
- A React frontend consuming backend APIs to render tutorials, code examples, and navigation dynamically.  
- Markdown support for rich text tutorials, including code blocks and formatting.  
- Dockerized backend and database for consistent development and deployment environments.  
- Full TypeScript support for end-to-end type safety.

### Why this project?

It is designed to help practice:

- Modeling and querying relational data with Prisma and PostgreSQL.  
- Building robust RESTful APIs.  
- Integrating a React frontend with a backend API for dynamic data.  
- Using Docker to containerize backend and database for easy setup.

## 📦 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreamarciano/code-atlas
cd code-atlas
```

### Install dependencies

Open two terminals:

- Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

- Backend:

```bash
cd /backend
npm install
```

### Run development servers

Open two terminals:

- Frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Backend:

```bash
# Build Docker images (only needed the first time or after Dockerfile changes)
docker compose build

# Run Prisma migrations inside the Docker container
docker compose run app npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Start backend and database containers
docker compose up
```

To stop backend and database containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```
