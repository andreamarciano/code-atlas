## 1 - Navbar: Seeding Languages and Displaying Them in the Navbar {#navbar}

Explains how we statically prepopulate the database with supported programming languages using a seed script, and how these are dynamically fetched and displayed in the Navbar component.

## 2 - Searchbar: Language Lookup and Navigation {#searchbar}

Details the logic behind making the searchbar functional. Describes the backend route refactor, how the `/api/languages/:name` endpoint works, and how the frontend uses it to navigate to the correct language page or show a "Not Found" view.

## 3 - User Authentication: Favorites and Personal Notes {#userauth}

## 4 - Advanced User Authentication with JWT and Bcrypt {#userauth-advanced}
